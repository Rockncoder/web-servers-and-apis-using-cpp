# 🦅 Soar with Crow: C++ Web Servers & APIs

> *"In the beginning, there was C. And Dennis Ritchie said 'Let there be objects,' and Bjarne Stroustrup created C++. And now you're making web servers with it... what a time to be alive!"*

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is Starter Code ⚠️

This repository contains the **starter code** for the LinkedIn Learning course:
### [Web Servers and APIs Using C++](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/web-servers-and-apis-using-c-plus-plus/)

**Follow the complete tutorial on LinkedIn Learning for step-by-step instructions!**

Welcome to the most unnecessarily exciting README you'll ever read about C++ web servers! If you're reading this, you're either:

1. A LinkedIn Learning student ready to build something awesome
2. Lost and desperately clicking through GitHub repositories
3. My future employer doing due diligence (hello there! 👋)

## 🚀 What Is This Madness?

This repository contains a hands-on guide to building a C++ web server using Crow (it's like Flask, but for people who enjoy typing semicolons). We'll containerize it with Docker and deploy it to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, because nothing says "I'm serious about web development" like using C++ when JavaScript would have been perfectly fine.

## 🧙‍♂️ Prerequisites

Before embarking on this perilous journey, you'll need:

- An AWS account (with money to burn or a free tier)
- Docker Desktop (to containerize your life choices)
- VS Code (or vim if you're trying to impress someone)
- AWS & EB CLI (because GUIs are for the weak)
- Git (optional, but so is happiness in C++ development)
- A sense of humor (mandatory)

## 🗺️ The Three Epic Quests

The LinkedIn Learning course walks you through THREE complete adventures:

### 🏗️ Quest 1: Building a C++ Web Server with Crow
Learn how to create a minimal web server that responds with "Hello, Crow" - achieving in 20 lines of C++ what you could do in 2 lines of Python (but where's the fun in that?).

### 🚢 Quest 2: Deploying to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Push your creation to the cloud, because running things locally is so 2010. Impress your friends by saying, "Yeah, my C++ app is in production on AWS."

### 🍃 Quest 3: Integrating with MongoDB Atlas
Connect your C++ server to a MongoDB database, because relational databases are too mainstream. Store and retrieve JSON data like it's the future (it is).

## 🛠️ Get Started

Ready to dive in? Follow these steps:

1. **Clone this starter code repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rockncoder/web-servers-and-apis-using-cpp.git cppweb
```

2. **Head over to LinkedIn Learning to follow the course**:
[Web Servers and APIs Using C++](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/web-servers-and-apis-using-c-plus-plus/)

3. **Follow along with the instructor as you build, deploy, and enhance your C++ web server**

The course will walk you through everything from building your first Docker container to deploying your application on AWS and connecting to MongoDB.

## 🤔 But Why?

You might be asking yourself, "Why build a web server in C++?" Well, why climb Mount Everest? Why explore the depths of the ocean? Why put pineapple on pizza?

Because we can.

And maybe, just maybe, because understanding how to build web services in a language as powerful as C++ gives you superpowers that the average JavaScript developer can only dream of. Plus, it makes for a great conversation starter at tech meetups:

"So, what do you do?"
"Oh, I build web servers in C++."
*awkward silence*
"...But why?"

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- How to use the Crow microframework
- Docker multi-stage builds
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment
- MongoDB integration with C++
- Patience. Lots of patience.

## 📝 Final Thoughts

Remember, friends don't let friends write web servers in C++ without proper error handling. This is for educational purposes, not to replace your Node.js production stack (unless you really want to impress/confuse your coworkers).

Don't forget to check out the [full LinkedIn Learning course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/web-servers-and-apis-using-c-plus-plus/) for step-by-step instructions and expert guidance!

Happy coding, and may your segfaults be few and your deployments be smooth!
